- Check out vimeo for videos on devops days cali
  - Specifically a video about metrics and build pipeline
  - i think there are two one is theory and other is implementation
- different companies
  - us
  - bazaar voice
    - very similar to us
    - new stuff releases slower than legacy even though they could release
    anytime
    - hard to be disciplined to do new stuff correctly, i.e. skip writing
    tests to write code
