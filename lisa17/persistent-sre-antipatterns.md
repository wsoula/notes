Persistent SRE Antipatterns
---
* alerts should tell you when you have problems not NOC or customers
* cattle not pets
* configuration (mis)management
  * should have immutable infrastructure
  * standardized images
* error budget
* most expensive model is embedded SRE in team
* next is consultant model with a checklist etc (sit with sre and go over it to keep from breaking in prod)
  * can get burned when there is a lot of work to do at the end cause they didn't think about it in the beginning
* frameworks delivered to product team that has the things SRE needs them to have
* Instead of N+1 nines find set of impacts you are willing to except
* SLO - service level objectives
