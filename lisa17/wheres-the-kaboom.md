Where's the Kaboom
---
* demolition vs. construction
  * everyone thinks they can do it
  * does not work well with others - demo company must control area exclusively
  * known structure vs. unnown structure
  * materials: certainty vs unknown
* keys to process
  * reverse engineering
  * last on, first off - stripping layers in reverse order it was put on
  * exception: the floor - last thing to go
* sustainable demolition
  * design for disassembly
* what makes it easier
  * transparency - visible and easy to identify
  * regularity - similar throughout
  * simplicity
  * limited number of components - easier to dismantle composed of smaller number of large things than larger number of small things
  * use a simple, regular layout
  * layer building systems
  * use common, standard shapes and connections
  * use removalbe fasteners; avoid adhesives
  * use salvaged materials.  if they were slavaged once they can probably  be salvaged again
  * document materials and methods of deconstruction
  * design connections that are accessible
  * separate systems
  * design to the worker and labor of separation
  * simplicity of structure and form
  * interchangeability
* Brand's Six S's - how buildings learn
  * site - Amazon(?) - be there forever
  * structure - be there 30-300 years
  * skin - 20 years
  * services - that run within, electrical, plumbing etc - 7-15 years
  * space plan - 3 years commercial and 30 years home
  * stuff - unknown
  * shearing layers of change that are in constant friction
* think about the shearing layers in your systems and their different life cycles
