* Instead of loading ES, why not put the data on an EBS drive and have new nodes/conatiners read from that to load data
* docker 12 and deploying phoenix HA
* docker for AWS, doing above

dockerfile that go get svcgen (sean) (or git clone it) and runs it, then running your application with gomon so as you make changes it redeploys in that container
  start with `docker-compose up`
