Chat Ops and Jenkins
---
I am very excited to be attending the Jenkins User Conference on the East Coast
this year.  This will be my third presentaiton at a JUC and fourth time to
attend, but all that was done at JUC West.  I have learned about a lot of cool
stuff in the past, which is why I started presenting, to tell people about the
cool stuff we are doing at Drilling Info.  One of the cooler things we have
implemented in the last year is Chat Ops and our bot Sparky.  It started as
something neat to play with ("Oooo lots of kittens") but quickly turned into
something more serious.
Ever get asked the same questions over and over?  What jobs to run to deploy
your code?  What is the status of the build?  These question and more can
all be automated so you do not have to keep answering them.  Furthermore,
when you do get asked you can show them, and everyone else, how to get the
information by issuing the proper commands in a chat room for everyone to see.
With chat rooms functioning as the 21st century water coolers, putting the
information in the middle of the conversation is a powerful teaching technique.
You are not sending people to some out dated documentation on how to get their
code deployed, nor are you showing them the steps today only to be forgotten
tomorrow.  Instead you can deploy your code and they see the exact steps
needed to get their code deployed.
Even more impressive is the way ChatOps can bring your company together.
Recently our CTO got a hipchat account so he could interact with Sparky.  This
gave me the idea that if we extend Sparky to deliver information useful to the
other teams (Sales, Marketing, Finance, etc) then we would be able to get these
wildly disparate teams in the same chat room together and hopefully they will
talk and learn from each other.  Where DevOps is the bringing together of Dev
and Ops, ChatOps can be the bridge across the entire organization.
Come see my presentation Day 1:Track 1 at 4:00 PM to learn how ChatOps can
enrich your team, how Drilling Info is using it, and what our future plans
entail for ChatOps.
