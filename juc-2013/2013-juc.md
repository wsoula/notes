# GHPRB Workflow

## Where is it in the SDLC
## What is the workflow
## How to keep work from being merged too soon

# Presenter Notes

- Where is it in the SDLC? - Starts and ends in the dev part of the SDLC and is a small little CI loop
- What is the workflow? - Create your feature branch and begin work, upon first commit or after tests committed open pull request, continue pushing to your feature branch as normal, profit from CI on a dev branch
- How to keep pull request from being accepted too soon - Put pull request in review card, denote it is in progress in the title

# How To Test Codebase

## Monolithic Codebase
## Modularized Codebase

# Presenter Notes

- Monolithic - All code in one repo, run like normal build
- Modules and sub-modules - If tests are in same repo, pass sha and refspec, run down stream tests against them.  If running downstream tests - Publish to different location, pass to repository manager (bower, ivy, maven, etc)

# Beyond Tests

## Deployment of Docs

# Presenter Notes

- Deployment of documentation - Why?  People without access to github, people not tech savvy.  How - Do doc build, if it is a pull request figure out the pull request number, change the deploy location, deploy to "pr" folder, deploy as normal, if last commit was a pull request, delete the pull request deploy

#Beyond Tests

## Customer demos
## When pull request was merged

# Presenter Notes

- Customer demos, both internal and external
    - Deploy your latest code continuously so other dev can work on consuming your latest code (dual agile), instead of waiting for one to finish before other starts
    - If using monolithic codebase can deploy what is coming next to a site for consumption and feedback on the beta
- Comment in pull request buid number deployed in, but only if already commented
    - Get pull request number from last git message
    - Use that to comment on pull request using github api
