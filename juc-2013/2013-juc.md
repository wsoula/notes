    - Continue pushing to your feature branch as normal
    - Profit from CI on a dev branch

# How To Test Codebase

## Monolithic Codebase
## Modularized Codebase

# Presenter Notes

- Monolithic
    - All code in one repo
    - Run like normal build
- Modules and sub-modules
    - If tests are in same repo
        - Pass sha and refspec
        - Run down stream tests against them
    - If running downstream tests
        - Publish to different location
        - Pass to repository manager (bower, ivy, maven, etc)

# Beyond Tests

## Deployment of Docs

# Presenter Notes

    - Why
        - People without access to github
        - People not tech savvy
    - How
        - Do doc build
        - If it is a pull request figure out the pull request number
            - Change the deploy location
            - Deploy to "pr" folder
        - Deploy as normal
        - If last commit was a pull request, delete the pull request deploy

#Beyond Tests

## Customer demos
## When pull request was merged

# Presenter Notes

- Customer demos, both internal and external
    - Deploy your latest code continuously so other dev can work on consuming your latest code (dual agile), instead of waiting for one to finish before other starts
    - If using monolithic codebase can deploy what is coming next to a site for consumption and feedback on the beta
- Comment in pull request buid number deployed in, but only if already commented
    - Get pull request number from last git message
    - Use that to comment on pull request using github api
