Monitoring and Observability
---

Monitoring needs to evolve
* User Experience is king
* short-lived resources
* more devices, more data
* faster release velocity

Observability is the goal
* logs - cloudwatch logs
* metrics - cloudwatch metrics
* traces - x-ray

Collect
* metrics - cloudwatch anomaly detection - alarm with dynamic threshold

monitor
* cross account, cross region dashboards
* automatic dashboards
* metric math

act
* synthetics
* anomaly detection
* metric math alarms
