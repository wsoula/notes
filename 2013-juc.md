- Three ways to deploy with ghprb
  - run unit tests
  - run down stream tests against sha and refspec of PR
  - pass sha to bower to pull as dependency of 2nd cloned repo instead of checked in value and then run acceptance tests
  - deployment of documentation to tests server before hitting main site (deads and wintersmith)
