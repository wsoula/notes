GitHub Pull Request Builder Workflow
Will Soula, Drilling Info

GitHub Pull Request Builder has enabled a new workflow for our company. Almost automatic CI on a dev branch. Pull Request deploys. Problems setting it up. Things I did to extend it: delete pull request deploys, comment in pull request build number integrated in.

Intro
---
This work flow is something I have been wanting for a long time.  If you look back on the mailing lists you will find me asking about pre-commit testing using svn.  This is when I first found out about gerrit.  Last JUC in San Francisco I heard talk about the ghprb and it sat in the back of my head as something interesting to try and implement, since the new platform was using github.  I tested it out in my local jenkins, had a few issues setting it up, but ultimately got it working and then implemented it in the main Jenkins.  The developers were confused at first about what these new comments on their pull requests meant, but thought it was cool when explained.

GHPRB Workflow
---
- Show SDLC, zoom into dev bubble and show a ghprb loop
- Create your feature branch and begin work
- Upon first commit go to GitHub and create pull request
- Continue work as normal
- Profit from CI on a dev branch

Test Codebase
---
- monolithic everything combined
    - run like normal build
    - easiest
- modules and sub-modules
    - have to pass sha and refspec
        - run down stream tests against them
        - pass to repository manager (bower, ivy, maven, etc)
    - harder
- Three ways to deploy with ghprb without committing to mainline
  - run unit tests
  - run down stream tests against sha and refspec of PR
  - pass sha to bower to pull as dependency of 2nd cloned repo instead of checked in value and then run acceptance tests, using grunt pass it as a command line parameter
  - deployment of documentation to tests server before hitting main site (deads and wintersmith)

Beyond Tests
---
- deployment of documentation (DEADS)
    - do doc build
    - if it is a pull request figure out the pull request number
        - change the deploy location
        - filename=build-$pr.zip;deployLocation=pr/$pr
    - deploy as normal
    - if last commit was a pull request, delete the pull request deploy
- Customer Demos, both internal and external
    - deploy your latest code continuously so other dev can work on consuming your latest code (dual agile), instead of waiting for one to finish before other starts
    - if using monolithic codebase can deploy what is coming next to a site for consumption and feedback on the beta
- comment in pull request buid nunber deployed in, but only if already commented
    - get pull request number from last git message
    - use that to comment on pull request using github api

Problems
---
- Self signed ssl
    - github enterprise
    - older jenkins/git
    - upgrade of git plugins gave better logging
- Incorrect urls
    - place 1
    - place 2
- Advanced section in global config
    - token field
    - other 1
