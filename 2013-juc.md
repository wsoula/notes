GitHub Pull Request Builder Workflow
Will Soula, Drilling Info

GitHub Pull Request Builder has enabled a new workflow for our company. Almost automatic CI on a dev branch. Pull Request deploys. Problems setting it up. Things I did to extend it: delete pull request deploys, comment in pull request build number integrated in.

GHPRB Workflow
---
- Show SDLC, zoom into dev bubble and show a ghprb loop
- Create your feature branch and begin work
- Upon first commit go to GitHub and create pull request
- Continue work as normal
- Profit from CI on a dev branch

Test Codebase
---
- monolithic everything combined
    - run like normal build
    - easiest
- modules and sub-modules
    - have to pass sha and refspec
        - run down stream tests against them
        - pass to repository manager (bower, ivy, maven, etc)
    - harder
- Three ways to deploy with ghprb without committing to mainline
  - run unit tests
  - run down stream tests against sha and refspec of PR
  - pass sha to bower to pull as dependency of 2nd cloned repo instead of checked in value and then run acceptance tests, using grunt pass it as a command line parameter
  - deployment of documentation to tests server before hitting main site (deads and wintersmith)

Beyond Tests
---
- deployment of documentation (DEADS)
    - do doc build
    - if it is a pull request figure out the pull request number
        - change the deploy location
        - filename=build-$pr.zip;deployLocation=pr/$pr
    - deploy as normal
    - if last commit was a pull request, delete the pull request deploy
- Customer Demos, both internal and external
    - deploy your latest code continuously so other dev can work on consuming your latest code (dual agile), instead of waiting for one to finish before other starts
    - if using monolithic codebase can deploy what is coming next to a site for consumption and feedback on the beta
- comment in pull request buid nunber deployed in, but only if already commented
    - get pull request number from last git message
    - use that to comment on pull request using github api

Problems
---
- Self signed ssl
    - github enterprise
    - older jenkins/git
    - upgrade of git plugins gave better logging
- Incorrect urls
    - place 1
    - place 2
- Advanced section in global config
    - token field
    - other 1
