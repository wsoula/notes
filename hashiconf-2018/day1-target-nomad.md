Already had
* Didnt use kubernetes because it is difficult to manage and they already had stuff in the cloud and didnt want to rearchitect that
* Mesos/marathon - super complicated
* chef - legacy
Nomad won - here's why
* consistency
* speed of deployment
* integrates directly with consul and vault
* multi-region support
* terraform deployments
Immediate Value Add
* POC to production to scale - really fast
* Allows them to iterate much quicker
* Multiple teams onboarded
